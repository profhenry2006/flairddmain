                    <p class="hideme">Rock 'n' roll the ball to my court. Let's play and have some fun with a mockup/demo of your impending project. The quality of my works is enough indication for you to have a clue of what your project will look like. But I have more surprises for you. <span class="white-text">I am offering to do a FREE mockup/demo design for you to decide if we should continue to development</span>. I want you to be absolutely sure of your investment in my services.</p>
                    <h2 class="hideme">Why Double Does it better</h2>
                    <p>ME = Designer + Developer. You + Me = Partnership. I collaborate with you to come up with brilliant ideas and execute them flawlessly. You bring your thoughts to the table and I bootstrap them with mine. Then, you leave it to me and watch as I execute our ideas from start to finish.</p>
                    <p>The norm is to have a designer and a developer work on your project. That means you will have to pay two or more persons for separate roles. Sometimes developers find it hard to translate designs into code just exactly as it was designed. On the other hand, a designer may not be able to understand the complexities of design when translated to codes by the developer. That will impact your project negatively, cause conflict, cost time and money.</p>
                    <p><span class="white-text">Having a skilled designer that doubles as a skilled developer is a big advantage to your project</span>. Imagine killing two birds with one shot. I am able to build your project from ground up. I combine deep technical expertise with artistic talent to ensure that the design is well developed. With your cooperation, I can accomplish your project in a simple and efficient process.</p>

                                First, I need to know everything about you and your project. That's why I will ask a lot of questions - what's your motivation, your target audience, your competitors and so on. Once I get familiar with your project, we can define the main objectives and what you want to achieve. Then we can structure the project plan and kick off the next phase.

                                In the Design phase we do lots of design exploration, such as sketching, wire-framing, interface and visual design iterations in order to find the best solution possible that matches the main objectives. Once we have the design direction set and approved, we are ready to hand off all assets for implementation.

                                This is when we start to implement the design. This phase could be mostly technological development, print production or both. What I do is finding the tools and frameworks that best suit the project's needs, and then - I use them.

                                This is when your project become available for use. I ship it to production after all checks and test. Once the project is shipped, I prepare detailed user guides and documentation. Afterwards I am still available for ongoing support and evaluation of the achieved results.
