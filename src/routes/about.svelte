                    <p>My name is <span class="white-text">Henry Egharevba</span>, nickname <span class="white-text">Prof Henry</span>. I'm a full-time Edo man and part-time resident of Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Besides digital things, I like watching documentaries and sports. I read a lot, work a lot, play a lot, and I joke apart. I believe that talents should be engaged without any form of prejudice. I mean, if you love <a href="solutions" class="clk bub1">what I do</a>, why not <a href="contact" class="clk bub3">contact me</a> to discuss about your project? My principle is to give the best of my talents and utmost commitment for every project.</p>

                                <span class="white-text">Since 2007</span>, I've worked with forward-looking persons and businesses to birth ideas, express passion, and communicate their stories in new and meaningful ways. I support clients to make the most of modern digital technologies and grow by leaps and bounds. I create beautiful, functional website and applications that are fast, secure, accessible, easy to use, responsive, search optimised, cost-effective, and deeply loved by users. Above all, you get a world-class website and brand identity that you can be proud of.

                                FlairDD has evolved through many stages. As explained in the tab above, DD basically is the abbreviation for Designer and Developer. Flair means a special or instinctive aptitude or ability for doing something well. In all, I am a Designer and Developer with Flair for creative designs and code development. My mission is to help you <span class="white-text">fly your ideas</span> and solve real world problems. The primary colour of the brand is a tint of Catalina Blue - #233d63, which is part of the Classic Colour Collection. Being my all time favourite colour, Blue is associated with intelligence, calmness, logic, thoughtfulness and creativity. It is a colour of loyalty, strength, wisdom and trust. The secondary colour is a tone of Orange - #f5c070, which is stimulatory, conjuring feelings of excitement, enthusiasm, and warmth. The suplementary colours are #a5b0bf, #ffffff, and #000000.

                    <p>I'd like to work on your ideas and projects. I can do things Ã¡ la carte (<span class="white-text">redesign cobweb site</span>) but I really love diving into <span class="white-text">fresh projects</span> from the onset.

                    <p>A lot of entrepreneurs and small business owners come from a similar background as mine. <span class="white-text">We have ideas that we believe can shake the world. We see the impact we can make and recognize the skills we have to get it done</span>. However, such ideas may never get off the ground except there is good enough force to make it fly.

                        <h4 class="hideme">2001-2006</h4>
                        <p>Yeah! I discovered Internet in 2001. Maybe not a typical love affair, but I became engaged to the Internet and it refined my thinking faculties. I fell in love with it to the extent that I had to miss crucial B.Sc classes by sneaking to Internet cafe. By the way, I majored in Mathematics Economics at The University of Benin. People hardly believe when I say that I have never stepped foot on a web design classroom. All I'm able to do today is a result of sleepless nights and long days of learning from the internet. I would spend days and nights surfing the web for information and materials. There were only a few Internet Cafe at that time. And the speed was very slow. My interest developed further into fascination and curiosity about how websites are created. My flair for digital media was budding and buzzing.</p>

                        <h4 class="hideme">2007</h4>
                        <p>Thought I had learnt enough to actually build a standard website. Looking back at my first standard website, I kinda wonder if I am the one that created such a half-mess, lol. But it qualified as one of the best at a roockie level. You may remember the age of Dreamweaver, that's the application I was using at the time. Do designers still fancy it today? I guess NO. We are in the age of libraries and frameworks. I must say that Dreamweaver literaly weaved my dreams and set a pedestal along my journey. After lots of trial and errors, the quality of my works became better over time. A client nicknamed me Prof, a non-academic chieftaincy title earned due to my expertise. I finally said &quot;I DO&quot; to this thing called web design and development. Got married to it but broke up rather unfortunately after a pretty decent honeymoon. Some other life activities stole my heart. I just couldn't resist it. Such is life.</p>

                        <p>Though I was doing well with my new found love, I just couldn't stop stalking my first love. Well, we made up. At comeback, I became more energised and focused for the next phase. With advanced knowledge and tools, the quality of my works have become much better. I am investing more time and money trying to acquire new skills, knowledge, and build a new family of clients and partners.
